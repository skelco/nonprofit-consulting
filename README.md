# Root + Restore Collective Web App

A modern nonprofit-focused web application built using **React 19**, **TanStack Router**, and **Vite**. Designed for the Root + Restore Collective to support mission-driven work through a dynamic, equity-centered, human-first digital experience.

---

## 🌱 Mission-Driven Design

Root + Restore Collective partners with nonprofits and grassroots organizations to co-create:

- Community-centered fundraising systems
- Equity-rooted strategic planning
- Values-based storytelling & culture building

This web application serves as the digital foundation for that mission, reflecting the same core values:

- Equity in Action
- Community over Ego
- Liberation through Systems Change

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app using **Vite** at `http://localhost:5173` (default).

> ⚠️ **Do not manually edit `routeTree.gen.ts`** — it's generated automatically from route files.

| `npm run format` | Run Prettier on all `.js` and `.jsx` files in `src/`  |

## 🧭 Routing with TanStack

This app uses **[@tanstack/react-router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)** for all route handling.

- Routes are file-based and automatically compiled with:

  ```bash
  npm run routes
  ```

- Root layout is managed via `__root.jsx`, which includes:

  - `<Navbar />`, `<Footer />`, and the dynamic `<Outlet />`
  - Suspense fallback handling

### Devtools

Development includes built-in router devtools:

```js
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools';
```

These help visualize route hierarchy, path state, and loader data.

## 🧹 Code Quality Tools

### ✅ ESLint

- Uses **Flat Config**
- React + JSX-A11Y + Import rules
- Custom rule bans default-exported arrow functions

### 🖌 Prettier

- Handles formatting for JS/TS, JSON, CSS, Markdown
- Integrated via `eslint-config-prettier`

### 🐶 Husky + lint-staged

- **Husky**: Prevents bad commits
- **lint-staged**: Runs formatters/lint only on changed files

#### Configuration:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "prettier --write"
  ],
  "*.{json,css,md}": [
    "prettier --write"
  ]
}
```
